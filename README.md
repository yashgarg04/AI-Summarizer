# AI-Summarizer

Alongside building this application, I've learnt how to:

1. setup a ReactJS project using Vite
2. create a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
3. make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
4. save history using the local storage
5. handle form events and catch errors
6. implement copy to clipboard
7. write clean code
